Dalype Gallery is located on the corner of Bentsegata and Maridalsveien in a building that is a part of the picturesque Omholt courtyard. The old cobble-stone courtyard with the surrounding houses were bought by Aage Omholt in 1940. The half-timbered houses are mainly from the 1900th century, having housed around 90 people in 1875. In 2001 the houses were designated as listed buildings by Byantikvaren. See the map &#187;</p><p>WHEN: 1–16 May.

Simply Human : ”The series is a dive into man’s rich inner life: emotions, passions, small signs and also the unanswered and unexplored.” Place Norway: ”Place is an important and powerful component for man’s identity. Therefore through my art I explore places that I feel connection with, and I try to express that experience.”</p><p>PURCHASE: If you want to buy paintings that are exhibited at Dalype Gallery, please contact the gallery at 22 95 12 33.
