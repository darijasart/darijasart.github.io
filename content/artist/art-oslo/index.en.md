AT THE STAND: Oil paintings, photos and the exotic kubbestol!

COME AND SEE MY CRAZY KUBBESTOL: My boyfriend's grandfather was a handy man, and one of his doings was a traditional kubbestol, made of a whole pice of wood. We dug it out in my boyfriend's uncle's storage room - dusty and unfinished. After some rounds with sand paper I covered it with white and now the exciting part starts. I want to decorate it. Paint it. Not with a traditional Norwegian rosemaling, but with my own pattern. So called Darija's kruseduller. I think it is an interesting combination of old and modern. Come to Art:Oslo to my stand, and see how this experiment will turn up!
