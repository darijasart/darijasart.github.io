### Kubbestol (wooden chair) is an exciting experiment combining traditional Norwegian craftsmanship with modern decoration in Darija's style.

**COME AND SEE MY CRAZY KUBBESTOL:** My friend's grandfather was a handy man, and one of his doings was a traditional kubbestol, made of a whole pice of wood. We dug it out in my friend's uncle's storage room - dusty and unfinished. After some rounds with sand paper I covered it with white and now the exciting part starts. I want to decorate it. Paint it. Not with a traditional Norwegian rosemaling, but with my own pattern. So called Darija's kruseduller. I think it is an interesting combination of old and modern. Come to Art:Oslo to my stand, and see how this experiment will turn up!

### How i started:

![From traditional to fusion design](Scheme-kubbestol.jpg)

Can't stop! Now I started on another, normal though, chair we had at home. Since my BF very much wanted to keep its main purpose - be as a smth to stand on I decided to paint it underneath. Isn't it great? You can stand on it, use it rough as much as you want and it will keep its artistic value. Like those expensive cloths, you know, those you can see special marks only if you take them off... So.. bring along your old wooden furniture!
