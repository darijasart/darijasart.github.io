title: Darija's art
---
I am UX expert and team lead for developers in IT sector. This page shows some of the visual art I worked with -
painting, illustration, animation and photography. ”As an escape from all the technological magic that surrounds
me daily, I have rediscovered the value of traditional art. For me oil painting is a travel back to the origins.
My interpretation of simple truth is often characterized with a black color and use of the graphic line. Themes
that keep coming back in my art are ‘Place’ and ‘Human’.
